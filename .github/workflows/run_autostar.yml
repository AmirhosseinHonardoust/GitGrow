name: GitGrowBot AutoStar (Scheduled)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot autostar bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered every hour at minute 5, and can also be run manually.
# The autostar bot processes stargazers and logs reciprocity results.
# It fetches state from the tracker-data branch and commits results back there.
# It also uploads the stargazer logs as an artifact.
