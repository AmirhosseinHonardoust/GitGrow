# .github/workflows/run_autostargrow.yml
name: GitGrow StarGrow (Scheduled)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot autostargrow bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered four times per day (00:20, 06:20, 12:20, 18:20 UTC), and can also be run manually.
# It performs growth starring from config/usernames.txt, with results committed to the tracker-data branch and exported as an artifact.
# If .github/state/stargazer_state.json is missing, autotrack.py is called as a precaution to ensure all logic can proceed.
