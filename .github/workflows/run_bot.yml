# name: GitGrowBot Scheduled Runner (Global)
# #
# # This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot scripts on a schedule.
# # It is triggered by a cron schedule and can also be run manually.
# #
# # The workflow is designed to run the unfollow bot and the follow bot.
# # The unfollow bot is responsible for unfollowing users who do not follow back.
# # The follow bot is responsible for following new users from our 5500+ users.
