# .github/workflows/run_autostarback.yml
name: GitGrowBot AutoStarBack (Scheduled)
# This workflow is used to run the GitGrowBot autostarback bot on a schedule.
# It is triggered every hour at minute 5, and can also be run manually.
# It checks for new stars on repositories and updates the stargazer state accordingly.
# The results are committed to the tracker-data branch and uploaded as an artifact.
# It then uses the state file to determine which users repositories to star back.

  schedule:
    - cron: '20 0,6,12,18 * * *'  # Fine for most users. If you expect >100 new stargazers per day, increase run frequency or set a stricter per-run limit to avoid GitHub API rate limit stalls.
